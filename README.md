### Overall Picture
See the overall picture. You can see that we will have 3 microservices which we are going to develop and deploy together.

Basically we will implement e-commerce logic with only gRPC communication. We will have 3 gRPC server applications which are Product â€” ShoppingCart and Discount gRPC services. And we will have 2 worker services which are Product and ShoppingCart Worker Service. Worker services will be client and perform operations over the gRPC server applications. And we will secure the gRPC services with standalone Identity Server microservices with OAuth 2.0 and JWT token.

### ProductGrpc Server Application
First of all, we are going to develop ProductGrpc project. This will be Asp.Net gRPC Server Web Application and expose apis for Product CRUD operations.
